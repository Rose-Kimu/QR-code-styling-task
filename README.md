## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned
I learnt how to use flexbox for positioning elements.
I also learn how to bring together knowledge from different aspects that I have been learning
to build a full project.





### Continued development
I want to focus on responsive web development and mobile first approach especiially in building web applications.
I would also want to perfect my CSS positioning skills.



### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools page](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_dimension.asp) - This helped me to learn how to position the qr-code image within it's parent container so that it wouldn't overflow. I really liked this style and will use it going forward.
